# NLP-Series-Sentiment-Classification
A 5-Part Series on Natural Language Processing: Notebooks, Code and Dataset

This is a modified version of lectures I gave at Emory University on Data Science and Natural Language Processing
The data and content has been modified to make it public and usable.

The series is also available on my personal website: https://sifaelndandala.com

### Part 1: Natural Language Processing Foundations, Concepts, and Preprocessing Text Data
This covers core concepts in NLP such as corpus, documents, tokens, tokenization and general preprocessing. We also explore the Amazon Product dataset.



### Part 2: Natural Language Processing Features Extraction

This covers traditional feature extraction techniques including Bag of Words, N-grams, and TFIDF



### Part 3: Sentiment Classification with NaiveBayes and SVM - Linear Classifier

This notebook covers building sentiment classifiers with traditional features in Part 2. We leverage Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines


### Part 4: Modern Feature Engineering - Distributed Representation for Text Modelling

This notebook explores modern NLP feature extraction/generation technique like Word2Vec, CBOW and Skip-Gram Models


### Part 5: Sentiment Classification with Deep Learning using Keras


This notebook builds on features in part 4 to build deep learning classifiers for sentiment with Keras.
